The theory behind carbon dating is fairly simple. Scientists know that a small amount of naturally occurring carbon is carbon-14. Although carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 through beta decay, the amount of carbon-14 in the environment remains constant because new carbon-14 is always being created in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays. Living things tend to ingest materials that contain carbon, so the percentage of carbon-14 within living things is the same as the percentage of carbon-14 in the environment. Once an organism dies, it no longer ingests much of anything. The carbon-14 within that organism is no longer replaced and the percentage of carbon-14 begins to decrease as it decays. By measuring the percentage of carbon-14 in the remains of an organism, and by assuming that the natural abundance of carbon-14 has remained constant over time, scientists can estimate when that organism died. For example, if the concentration of carbon-14 in the remains of an organism is half of the natural concentration of carbon-14, a scientist would estimate that the organism died about 5,730 years ago, the half-life of carbon-14." }, { "String" : "There are nearly ten million known carbon compounds and an entire branch of chemistry, known as organic chemistry, is devoted to their study.

Rio withdrew his claim when he received a letter from Paris disputing his discovery.

Silver fulminate, a powerful explosive, is sometimes formed during the silvering process. Silver iodide is used in seeding clouds to produce rain. Silver chloride has interesting optical properties as it can be made transparent; it also is a cement for glass. Silver nitrate, or lunar caustic, the most important silver compound, is used extensively in photography. Silver for centuries has been used traditionally for coinage by many countries of the world. In recent times, however, consumption of silver has greatly exceeded the output." },

As might be expected considering the similarities between their names and properties, scientists soon confused erbia and terbia and, by 1877, had reversed their names. What Mosander called erbia is now called terbia and visa versa. From these two substances, Mosander discovered two new elements, terbium and erbium. Today, terbium can be obtained from the minerals xenotime (YPO<sub>4</sub>) and euxenite ((Y, Ca, Er, La, Ce, U, Th)(Nb, Ta, Ti)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), but is primarily obtained through an ion exchange process from monazite sand ((Ce, La, Th, Nd, Y)PO<sub>4</sub>), a material rich in rare earth elements that typically contains as much as 0.03% terbium.</span>" },

She obtained polonium from pitchblende, a material that contains uranium, after noticing that unrefined pitchblende was more radioactive than the uranium that was separated from it. She reasoned that pitchblende must contain at least one other radioactive element. Curie needed to refine several tons of pitchblende in order to obtain tiny amounts of polonium and radium, another radioactive element discovered by Curie. One ton of uranium ore contains only about 100 micrograms (0.0001 grams) of polonium. Due to its scarcity, polonium is usually produced by bombarding bismuth-209 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This forms bismuth-210, which has a half-life of 5 days. Bismuth-210 decays into polonium-210 through beta decay.

At normal room temperatures, radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. The most common forms of radon decay through alpha decay. Alpha decay usually isn't considered to be a great radiological hazard since the alpha particles produced by the decay are easily stopped. However, since radon is a gas, it is easily inhaled and living tissue is directly exposed to the radiation. Although it has a relatively short half-life, radon decays into longer lived, solid, radioactive elements which can collect on dust particles and be inhaled as well. For these reasons, there is some concern as to the amount of radon present within homes. Radon seeps into houses as a result of the decay of radium, thorium or uranium ores underground and varies greatly from location to location.

More recently it was used as an orange glaze in contemporary Fiestaware© dishware but was later discontinued for health reasons. Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissileisotope. This means it can be split into two or three fragments (fission products) by thermal neutrons. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. This nuclear conversion can be brought about in breeder reactors where it is possible to produce more new fissionable material than the fissionable material used in maintaining the chain reaction.

The major source is the 85 MW High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA. In a HFIR \"campaign\", tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce heavier actinides and picogram quantities of fermium. The quantities of fermium produced in 20–200 kiloton thermonuclear explosions are believed to be of the order of milligrams, although it is mixed in with a huge quantity of debris. Forty picograms of <sup>257</sup>Fm were recovered from 10 kilograms of debris from the 'Hutch' nuclear test in 1969. After production, fermium must be separated from debris and a host of other actinides and lanthanide fission products by solvent extraction, ion exchange, etc.). The annual reactor production of fermium-257 is in the picogram range. However, pure <sup>255</sup>Fm (half-life 20 hours) can be easily isolated by \"milking\" the beta-decay daughter of pure <sup>255</sup>Es (half-life 39.8 days).</span>" },

Because the atoms of moscovium only existed for a tenth of a second, radiochemical proof was needed to support its syntheses. A Swiss scientist at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) performed the radiochemical experiment by analyzing a copper plate that had been placed behind the 243Am disc in the cyclotron. This copper plate collected all moscovium atoms that were synthesized and was processed through liquid chromatography techniques that yielded five times more moscovium atoms than produced by fusion alone.
